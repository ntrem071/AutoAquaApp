<i>Description</i>

Aquaponics simulates a miniature self-sustaining ecosystem. Fish break down the proteins from their feed into ammonium. 
In turn it is then oxidized by the system's bacteria residing in the biofilter to create nitrite and nitrate. The nitrate-rich 
water is pumped into a grow bed, vertical tower, or some form of plant holding pipes. This natural fertilizer is absorbed by the 
plants. In turn the plants filter the water to be sent back to the fish tank. When compared to traditional farming this process 
saves significantly more on its water consumption. Moreover, with recent advancements in LED lighting and the popularization of 
solar powered industrial farms, these setups can be made significantly more affordable with lower rates power consumption. The 
application of a more industrial vertical farming method also adds a space-saving aspect and requires shorter delivery routes to 
deliver food from farm to store.
